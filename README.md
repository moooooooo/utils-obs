Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORK IN PROGRESS. 
The HTML files are files i use in OBS Studio using the Browser plugin. There's also a Linux Browser plugin that does the same thing.
I'll list the files here and what they are used for in due course. Some of the files are duplicates and will be culled eventually.

Plans
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll add different HTML files here as time prograsses. 
This repo is stuff thought i'd share with anyone who's interested.

Peter.
